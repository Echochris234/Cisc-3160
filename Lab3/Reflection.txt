Throughout this Assignment I learned various tools that can be used in order to create. Programming language and how they relate with each other based on specifications. Jumping into something that I have never used before tested my ability to gather information and put it together in an effective manner. I decided to create a scientific calculator using some built in functions from C while also using lex and yacc to deploy these functions to the user. While there was a lot of set backs such as printing a valid statement when the user process an argument I was able to find a work around by using multiple print statements. For some reason Iâ€™m not allowed to print more than one variable at at time due to a type conversation error I could not figure out. Another error I ran into was when division by 0 was executed the program terminated. I was able to work around this by adding an if else statement that essentially handled the logic of deciding if the denominator was 0 or not. I was also able to use my command line a little more wit the C programming language. Learning various commands for different languages make using the command line more versatile and useful in the long run as opposed to using an IDE or a GUI that tends to come with a lot of overhead and use of system resources that can be used for other processes.
