Python:
 Create a multithreaded program:
Allocate a map for threads to live on
Create a mutex lock to keep sensitive data safe
Populate the data structure with open available slots
Create and run the created threads to simulate applications opening on a machine


C++:
Create a template file that is not concerned with what data type is passed into it but manipulates the data just the same
-Create a file called simple.h which holds the structure and functions of the template
-Create a file app.cpp which will contain the main application
